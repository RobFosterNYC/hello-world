Hello World Repository

I am a amateur java coder in hopes to master the craft of coding in java.
my goal is to eventually master 3 languages. Java, Python and C++.
But for now I will start with just 1, and that is Java.
I need a better job and skills that will help me live a happier life other than struggling to make ends meet.
In this day in age of April 2016, the age of coding and future endeavors in a evolving world of computer technologies. 
current job is forcing me into the harsh part of the world I do not wish to be in and I am just trying to make it better for myself.
Knowing that one day my job will be obsolete, so I must secure myself before that day.

Hopefully I can find new friends that will help me learn and flurish in the coding world.
I love creating things and im great with my hands tinkering with all kinds of electronics and gadgets.
I am always curious person with love of futuristic things including space and now I want to do the same with my brain by coding. 
I hope my journey takes me to a great and happier path as I try to live my life the best way I can.

here is one giant step in the coding world.
(takes first step).  *cue music* .....
